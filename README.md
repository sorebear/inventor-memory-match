# Memory Match

## Overview

> Inventor-Themed Memory Match is a game with 18 hexagonal cards face down and the player has to try and match all 9 pairs of matching cards BOTH in image and in orientation.

On every unsuccessful match, the first card selected will rotate clockwise, while the 2nd card selected will rotate counter-clockwise. On every successful match, the 2 cards will be displayed face for the remainder of the game. 

Once all pairs have been matched the user will be displayed a message that they have won the game. As the user clicks through the cards stats will be kept letting the user know how many attempts and the accuracy of their choices.
